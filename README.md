Media Talk App

This is an app that I created to demonstrate a social media website that uses various technologies. The app allows users to communicate with each other through posts, messages, video calls, and map markers. The app also has features such as authentication, CRUD operations, and CSS styling.

The app is built with the following technologies:

WebSockets: This is a protocol that enables real-time communication between the client and the server. I used socket.io to implement video calls and chat messages.

Supabase Postgres: This is a cloud database service that provides a PostgreSQL database with a user-friendly interface and SDK. I used Supabase to store all the user data, such as profiles, posts, messages, and markers. I also used Supabaseâ€™s authentication policies to secure the app.

JS, HTML, Node.js, React, Express: These are the languages and frameworks that I used to develop the front-end and back-end of the app. JS and HTML are the core languages for web development. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows me to run JS code on the server. React is a library that helps me create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Express is a framework that simplifies the creation of web servers and APIs.

Google Maps API: This is a service that provides access to maps and location data. I used Google Maps API to integrate a map component into my app, where users can create and view markers with messages.
